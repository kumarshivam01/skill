Q 4.  List any three ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML
    Ans:- 
        1. **Use Semantic HTML:**
        - Semantic HTML tags provide meaning and structure to content, making it easier for assistive technologies and users to understand the purpose of different elements. Some examples include:
            - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`: Use these semantic elements to define the structure of your document.
            - `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Use heading elements appropriately to create a clear document outline.
            - `<p>`, `<a>`, `<button>`, `<form>`: Ensure the correct use of these elements for paragraphs, links, buttons, and forms.

        2. **Provide Descriptive Text with Alt Attributes:**
        - Always include descriptive alternative text for images using the `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag. This text should convey the purpose or content of the image, assisting users who cannot see the image. For example:
            ```html
            <img src="example.jpg" alt="A group of people enjoying a picnic in the park">
            ```

        3. **Create Accessible Forms:**
        - Forms are a crucial part of many websites, and making them accessible is essential. Use the following techniques:
            - Associate form labels explicitly with their corresponding form controls using the `<label>` element or the `aria-labelledby` attribute.
